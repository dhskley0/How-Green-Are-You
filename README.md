🌱 How Green Are You?

"How Green Are You?" is an interactive quiz created for the Project Zero Plastic campaign. It encourages everyone to reflect on their daily habits and discover how eco-friendly they really are!

💡 About the Project

This project aims to raise awareness about the harmful effects of plastic pollution and inspire people to make small but impactful changes. It’s not about being perfect—it’s about making progress toward a cleaner, greener planet. 🌍

After answering fun and simple questions, users receive a personalized result showing their eco-level — from “You’re a Zero!” to “Eco Warrior!” Each result includes a message encouraging everyone to join the movement and take part in Project Zero Plastic.
